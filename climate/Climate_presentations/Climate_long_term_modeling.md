### Goal of this presentation

* Show you how long-term macro-climate scenarios are done
* Convince you that you should not invest your time and effort into this

Long-term = 50+ years, for our purposes.

--- 
### Long-term scenarios require economy-climate interactions
**Basic idea:** 
* GHG emissions cause economic harm in distant future
* Mitigating policies reduce GHG, but create disruption in the not so distant future 
	* Higher taxes, higher energy prices, asset values decline in certain sectors

**Key model ingredients:**
* Long-run supply (production function) linked to energy prices / taxes
* GHG emissions linked to economic activity / energy inputs used
* Global temperature linked to accumulated GHG emissions
* Economic activity linked to global temperature

**Useful features:**
* Sectoral modeling to account for high sectoral heterogeneity

**Model combination**:
* Useful outputs are usually generated by a combination of models, not one standalone model

**Conclusion:**
This is very complicated.

### Long-term scenarios in practice

**Very challenging to develop:**
* Completely different modeling tools than we currently use
* Need to account for climate modeling, long time horizons
* Linking GHG emissions to global temperature and economic activity relies on highly uncertain parameters
* Difficult to account for technological progress, adaptation of firms, households, etc. 
	* These dimensions are often omitted / held constant.

There are **"benchmark" scenarios available** (discussed further). These can serve as a useful reference point.

From practical standpoint, investing in the long-term modeling makes little sense on the level of individual institutions. 
* Unless you advise Biden, Xi, or Modi, you can treat GHG emissions as constant.

### IAM Models

**Integrated assessment models** are often used to produce long-term climate-economy scenarios.

Usually **do not have sufficient economic detail** to suffice for stress-testing on their own. They do the first step.

A short overview by [Nordhaus.](https://www.nber.org/reporter/2017number3/integrated-assessment-models-climate-change)

Overview / links to about a dozen IAMs available [here.](https://www.iamcdocumentation.eu/index.php/IAMC_wiki)

NGFS uses three IAMs:
* [REMIND-MAgPIE](https://www.iamcdocumentation.eu/index.php/Model_Documentation_-_REMIND-MAgPIE)
* [GCAM](https://www.iamcdocumentation.eu/index.php/Model_Documentation_-_GCAM)
* [MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM](https://docs.messageix.org/projects/global/en/latest/)

IAMs can be quite complicated. Let's have a look.

### REMIND-MAgPIE 
**REMIND (REgional Model of Investment and Development)**
	Energy-economy general equilibrium model linking a macro-economic growth model with a bottom-up engineering-based energy system model

**Macro:** Ramsey-type growth model.
* Production factors: capital, labor, and final energy 
* Production function with constant elasticity of substitution determines the final energy demand
* Output split to investment, consumption, trade, and energy system expenditures
* More than 50 technologies for conversion of primary energy into secondary energy and for the distribution of secondary energy carriers into final energy

**Energy:** Variety of fossil, biogenic, nuclear and renewable energy resource
* Macro and energy linked via the final energy demand and the costs incurred by the energy system 
* Economic activity results in demand for final energy

**Other:** 
* Taxes, subsidies
* Technological learning of emergent new technologies
* Adjustment costs
* ...

**Solution:** Find the welfare-optimal mix of investments in the economy and the energy sectors of each model region, given a set of population, technology, policy and climate constraints

Note: The [code](https://github.com/remindmodel/remind) is very complicated.

### REMIND-MAgPIE Cont.

**MAgPIE** (Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment
	Global land use allocation model, which is connected to the grid-based dynamic vegetation model LPJmL

**Agriculture:** Land use patterns, yields and total costs of agricultural production for each grid cell
* Food and feed energy for the demand categories can be produced by 20 cropping activities and 3 livestock activities

**Energy:** Energy demand is defined for an exogenously given population in 10 food energy categories, based on regional diets
* Region-specific 

**Solution:** Minimize total cost of production for a given amount of regional food and bioenergy demand

---

### Combining REMIND and MAgPIE:

* Iterative mode
* REMIND updates MAgPIE's assumptions regarding bioenergy demand and GHG prices
* MAgPIE updates REMIND's assumptions regarding bioenergy prices and land-use emissions and agricultural production costs
* Iterations continue until changes between iterations become negligible

### GCAM

**GCAM** (Global Change Assessment Model):
* Behavior and interaction of five systems: energy system, water, agriculture and land use, the economy, and the climate

Also very [complex model](https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/overview.html) with dozens of modules.

![[Pasted image 20230225001233.png|600]]


---
### MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM

* Five modules: energy (MESSAGEix), land use (GLOBIOM), air pollution and GHG (GAINS), macro (MACRO), climate (MAGICC)
* 11 regions
* Also [very complicated model](https://docs.messageix.org/projects/global/en/latest/)

### IAMs Summary

* Very complex models
* Usually combine economy, energy, agriculture, technology, GHG emissions, climate, and other modules
* The modules are often not linked endogenously, but iteratively
* Often work with regions, but not on the level of individual countries
* Most often work in 10-year windows
* Often developed since the 1980s or 1990s, with cross-disciplinary teams behind them
* Macroeconomy described usually by growth model: GDP, consumption, investment, capital, labor, ...
* **Not sufficiently detailed outputs for stress-testing**


---
### Some frameworks are less complicated

* 2020 Bank of France [Working Paper](https://publications.banque-france.fr/en/long-term-growth-impact-climate-change-and-policies-advanced-climate-change-long-term-accl-scenario) with model of long-term climate-economy interactions
* 30 regions
* Five different types of energy, linked to GDP and GHG emissions
* Endogenous TFP, dependent on energy prices (carbon taxes)
* Authors claim key relationships are estimated from panel data and actually provide a lot of potentially useful estimates of parameters and elasticities
*  Much more tractable model than the IAMs presented earlier, but still quite complex
* Scenario inputs: Relative energy prices, relative investment price, years of education, hours worked, employment rate, regulation index, capacity utilization; 
	* Building the scenarios is not trivial!
*  Note that the results are still not sufficiently rich for stress-testing without utilizing further models
* The paper finds quite substantial impact on global GDP

### NGFS Scenarios

* Current state-of-the art
* Comprehensive, updated frequently, comparatively rich macro, ...
* Will be covered in a separate presentation
* Better than [SSPs]([https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/ "https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change/")) because they are updated regularly

### Where does this leave us?

* Long-term macro-climate modeling is very complicated exercise
* Requires dedicated team with ample resources
* Outputs are: 
	* Surrounded by large uncertainty
		* Some argue that current scenario [grossly underestimate risks](https://actuaries.org.uk/media/qeydewmk/the-emperor-s-new-climate-scenarios.pdf)
	* Not detailed enough (geographically, available variables) => need to use e.g. CGE models which are not policy-invariant
	* Not clear if policy-relevant currently
* Our view: leave this to the experts, utilize what is available for directly relevant work
