### Before we start

* We are not climatologists
* What follows is our best understanding, but we can make errors
* Sources are provided, read them and and check if you agree with us
* We also have a large repository of annotated papers that are relevant to this topic, accessible to members
* Also, this is a depressing topic (health warning)

---
### The world is getting hotter

* Land is getting hotter faster than oceans
* The limits for global warming (1.5 degrees C) are for **global mean temperature**
	* [IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/): *Global warming is defined in this report as an increase in combined surface air and sea surface temperatures averaged over the globe and over a 30-year period*

### Personal experience - it is getting warmer...

### Humans are responsible

### Historically, it was mostly developed countries, but nowadays it is different

### Energy, industry, transport, agriculture

Note that **per capita GHG emissions are not increasing much**

### But what about...

* Measurement issues?
* Solar cycles?
* Heat islands?
* All the other things you read about on the internet that sound plausible?

[Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/whats-new/?cat=temperature-updates) was founded in early 2010 (originally called the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project) to address the major concerns from outside the scientific community regarding global warming and the instrumental temperature record.

Their [report](http://static.berkeleyearth.org/pdf/skeptics-guide-to-climate-change.pdf) addresses many popular concerns.

If you see a chart that "debunks the global warming", it's usually misleading:

### Evidence from more than just temperature measurements

### Climate models have done a good job so far

### Current policies imply further warming

Based on the [2023 IPCC Assessment](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/figures/)

### Strategies to deal with global warming (GW)

* **Climate mitigation:** measures to lessen the extent of GW
	* Switch away from fossil fuels to renewables
	* Better insulation of houses, improved technologies, ...
* **Climate adaptation:** measures to lessen the impact of GW
	* More resilient crops, improved ventilation, ....
	* Easier to do in advanced, rich countries
* Currently proposed policies are a mix of these two approaches
* But in terms of projected costs, climate mitigation seem to dominate
* The largest, costliest part seems to be the transition to clean energy sources

### Transition is happening due to technological progress

### It is happening faster than we expected

### It will happen in ways that are not easy to predict

### Decoupling of growth and emissions is possible

### Large uncertainty about impact on the economy

* Error bars around all long-term climate-economic scenarios are huge
	* *The NGFS scenarios have been generated by 3 different integrated assessment models* ([source][https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/explore])
* Data is not there
	* We have cross-country data, but that is quite noisy
	* We do not have relevant historical data to tease out impact of warming
* Climate policy is akin to macropru policy in that we want to have a **robust** policy, not optimal policy

---
### Long-term vs short-term view

* Climate-change is **decades-long process**
	* *Curse of the horizon*: costs in short-term, benefits in long-term.
* But focus on long-term might underplay **abrupt short-term impacts**, for example: 
	* effect of policies such as carbon taxes
	* revised market expectations 
* **We argue in favor of climate-risk-related stress-testing scenarios on traditional horizons of several years.**

**Long-term** (30+ years) view needed to show benefits of the transition.
**Short-term** (~5 years) view sufficient to analyze risks from the transition. Also aligns well with current tools.

### Macropru should do something, but we don't quite know what yet

BIS surveyed 28 institutions with macropru responsibility in 2020:

* large majority is concerned about climate-related risks, consider within their mandate to act
* large majority has conducted research on the topic
* majority of respondents have not yet factored, or considered factoring, the climate-related risks into the prudential capital framework

Commonly used approaches:
* qualitative studies on transmission channels
* quantitative on exposures to climate-related risks, often granular by sector or geography
* **scenario analysis, stress-testing**

### BIS survey: Key problems identified

1. **Data gaps**: not sufficiently granular, gaps in coverage, inconsistent across jurisdictions
2. **Lack of harmonized analytical frameworks**: climate-related risks are various and often require complex modeling with expertise in climate and energy
3. **Unclear transmission channels:** despite all the research, we are not there yet
4. **Time horizon misalignment:** FinStab/Macropru operates on much shorter horizon than climate modeling

### What is the situation in your country?

* Is there a mandate? 
* Is there a concern?
* Is there a specific framework / plan?
* Any work on data underway?
