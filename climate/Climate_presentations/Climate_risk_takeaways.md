### New challenges 
* We are dealing with **new sources of financial risks**
* New area, lots of **ongoing research**, best practices have not yet been established
* However, several points are becoming clear
	* Need for **scenario analysis**
	* Focus predominantly on **short-term**, possibly utilizing insights from long-term scenarios
		* Aligned with tools, mandates, current models
	* Focus predominantly on **transition risks**, as these can come more suddenly
	* Need to account for and synthesize possibly a number of **different sources of risk**
		* Asset prices change
		* Commodity price changes 
		* Carbon pricing
		* Foreign demand change
		* Decline in agricultural productivity
	* Rich narrative is important!

* **Data is a large obstacle**
	* We do not have accurate measures of vulnerability and exposure
	* This data is outside of our usual collection processes, expertise
	* Sometimes we can take data from other countries as benchmarks
* Need to **look outside of our countries**
	* Many shocks originate outside of our countries
	* Climate policies can affect countries globally

### Old tools?

* We should make **use of our current tools**
	* Climate modeling is extremely difficult, and mostly not necessary
	* We can capture climate risks within our current paradigm
* Use of suite of models
	* Structural model (DSGE-style) can help us understand the scenario in depth
	* Our current tools than can take the
* **Adaption** of tools might be needed, revolution probably not
* However, **processes will have to be updated**
	* New components of stress tests
	* Cooperation with private banks (pilot projects?)
	* New data collection
