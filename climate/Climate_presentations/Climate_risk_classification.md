### Physical and transition risks
* **Physical** risks stem from more frequent, more intense natural phenomena:
	* Heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, ...
	* Lower crop yields, lower labor productivity, ...
	* ...
* **Transition** risks stem from policies implemented to adapt, mitigate 
	* Carbon pricing
	* Stranded assets
	* Energy prices
	* ...
* For advanced economies, **transition risks are the dominant issue**
* For developing economies, **transition risks are probably also the dominant issue**
	* Physical risks can be important, but their frequency and intensity will not change abruptly, so our current models are still relevant and useful

### Within the context of traditional risk categories
* Climate risks can be understood and interpreted within the traditional risk categories
* We can (and should) utilize our existing tools to the fullest extent possible
* "Monetary policy approach" to macropru - try to capture as many issues within a limited number of frameworks and tools

### What is special about these risks?
* Most empirical literature focuses on **physical** risks - we have previous observations
* Transition risks can be analyzed basically only through **scenarios**, often in the context of climate modeling
* These risks can be highly **unevenly distributed** across economic sectors and also geographically
* Greater **uncertainty** about magnitudes, transmission channels, non-linearities, exposures
* Some likely to be more relevant for **non-bank financial institutions** such as insurance companies

### What is not special?

BIS posits that these risks can be observed through **traditional risk categories.**

Examples how to treat climate-related risks within current risk categories.

**Microeconomic:** Impact on counter-parties but also the banks themselves (cost of financing)
* *Credit risk:* Household wealth reduction from physical risks, energy sector and mining sector affected by carbon tax, technology, ...
* *Market risk:* repricing of physical and financial assets, e.g. value of unextracted coal reserves
* ...

**Macroeconomic:** impact on growth, productivity, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices

[BIS Paper](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.htm) has some quantitative estimates for various types of climate-related risks. Generally small, but not negligible.
